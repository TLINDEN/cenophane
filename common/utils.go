   Untaint user input, that is: remove all non supported chars.

   wanted is a  regexp matching chars we shall  leave. Everything else
   will be removed. Eg:

   untainted := Untaint(input, `[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]`)

   Returns a  new string  and an  error if the  input string  has been
   modified.  It's the  callers  choice  to decide  what  to do  about
   it. You may  ignore the error and use the  untainted string or bail
   out.
